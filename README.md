# Nostr Location

This is monorepo for exploring possibilities in location sharing on Nostr.

[Current specification](doc/NostrLocation.md) for location-first Nostr location events.
It adds specification for public location events.

Old (but valid) specification for [encrypted location sharing](doc/NIP-location.md).

There is command line tool [NEL](nel/README.md) for testing encrypted locations.

There is also [Spotstr](https://github.com/k0sti/spotstr) web client what supports encrypted `kind:30473` events.

Open design questions in [extension](doc/extension.md) document.
